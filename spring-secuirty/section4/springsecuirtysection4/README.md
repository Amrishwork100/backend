`map` transforms each element in a stream into another form individually,

**_`In Git,**_ `
the main difference between git fetch and git pull is that git pull applies changes to the current 
working directory, while git fetch does not:
**_`git fetch`_**
Downloads changes from a remote repository to the local repository, but doesn't change the current 
working directory. This allows you to review the changes without interrupting your current work.
**_`git pull`_**
Downloads changes from a remote repository and automatically merges them into the current branch. 
This directly applies the changes to the local working directory
